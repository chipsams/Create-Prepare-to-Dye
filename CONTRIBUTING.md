# Important

When you start working on a PR or any contribution, try to open a post on [‚Å†üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709) or mention on an issue on github to prevent cases of two people working on the same thing

# Testing
for @testers. 

- To help out head over to [‚Å†üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709) and see any posts with the üß™ Tests tag. Those are things that require testing and feedback. If there will a new specific thing to test that is important I will also ping this tag
- You can also test game design elements and give feedback on game pacing, recipe design, difficulty and of course, bugs

# Docs
for @contributors/docs and @pending/contributors/docs

- Adding tooltip descriptions to items in the game, especially ones with special behavior in the pack is highly important. To do that, check out the tooltips folder on [client scripts](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/tree/main/kubejs/client_scripts/tooltips) where you can see examples and where you can add your own. You can also post on [‚Å†üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709) about missing tooltips that are important and discuss there on the content
- Writing "to-be-stale" guides. Which means writing guides to help players start or do specific things in the pack, I call those to-be-stale because the goal is to provide the same info in game where possible, those are important because you can't always think of the correct way to implement a good in game explanation (see quartz tooltip for example) but writing a guide is lower friction and can help out immediately
- Adding ponders. Check out the ponder tag on [github issues](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/issues?q=ponder) to see what ponders are needed. Adding ponder requires careful thinking on smart explenations and a small amount of javascript knowledge. Posting an issue there or a post on ‚Å†[üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709) for ponders that you think are needed is also very important and helpful
- Renaming items to be more directly relevant to the packs theme and / or to simplfy, for example `Fluix ME Smart Cable -> Smart Cable` or `Iron Ingot -> White Ingot`
- Making botania book entries shorter. I personally believe they are too big and include too much fluff, also, because we scrape the same language files making those shorter and more concise makes them more suitable for tooltips
- Translations. Adding language files in your language that go over the ones we already added for en_us can help a lot because of how much name changes, tooltips, descriptions, flavor and other things we change add to the lang files
- Browse the issues tagged with docs on github, [there are many](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adocumentation) and see if there is anything you can help with.
- Github issues. Going over issues and adding more context to them is very helpful

# Code
for @contributors/code and @pending/contributors/code

- Tips: use vscode and install probejs to be able to use full autocomplete, critical for development.
- There are many things critical for the pack that are javascript related, in this are you will have to be a bit more proactive and see which things you can help with in terms of skills and knowledge, either in the issue tracker or in [‚Å†üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709). You can checkout the wrappers we wrote for all mod recipes (we use recipe.custom for almost everything because we are horrible people) which make it easy to add recipes even if you didn't specifically use Kubejs before. Take into account that writing kubejs with anything more complex than writing recipes will require frequent trips to their [discord server](https://discord.gg/lat)
- Don't be afraid to make a pr, even if you think your code is not the best, worst case we iterate on things together
 
# Art
for @contributors/art and @pending/contributors/art 

- Check out the tagged [issues](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aart+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to see where you can help. Also posts on ‚Å†[üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709) tagged with art

# Recipe design and Game design

- All ideas are very welcome on the matter, make sure to read the [design doc](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/blob/main/design-doc.md) and keep the rule of products=complex devices=simple assembly-lines=complex and post on ‚Å†[üíª-dev](https://discord.com/channels/890222432605057044/1179518463723716709)
